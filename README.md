# Investing in Surf and Ice Cream

In this week module we are focused on the analysis of the weather in Hawaii.  This is an exploratory analysis that consideres the last 12 months, starting from the last data point registered.  This analysis would serve as backup for a bussiness plan that would be presented to a potential investor.

## Overview

Our initial analysis was designed to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data stored in a **SQLite** database. From the database, we have access to daily measurements of temperatures and rain precipitation registered by diverse weather stations.  Now, we need to add temperature trends to our analysis, specifically, temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu.  This additional information would help us to determine if the surf and ice cream shop is sustainable year-round.
